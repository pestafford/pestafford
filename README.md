### Cyber Security Professional

I think big thoughts about life in the Singularity; how to stay safe and protect privacy in a post-privacy world. 

Deeply interested in AI Security (Keeping AI safe from US) and AI Safety (Keeping US safe from AI). Trying to prevent Skynet and maybe get a little closer to Multivac.

Always open to new friends. Come say hi. Youâ€™ll be glad you did.
